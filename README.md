# Discord.js v14 Handler!


The handler used here is of [Recon's](https://github.com/reconlx) `DJS v13` handler! I have changed many things and made it into `DJS v14` using the [Docs](https://deploy-preview-1011--discordjs-guide.netlify.app/additional-info/changes-in-v14.html#before-you-start)!


Install dependencies - `npm install`


Discord dev version - `npm i discord.js@dev`


Start - `node index.js` or `node .`
